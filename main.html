            >showcased a lot of amazing work, and obviously inspired me to
            create this website for this reading response. first i wanted to
            incorporate Vera's skeletype into a website somehow, but I think the
            page is either broken or super slow as I couldn't get an output OTF
            file. so instead I just thought to make a website
            <i>emulating Vera's.</i>
            <sup
              >(emulating is a strong word since i literally just took the code
              from your site and built off of it, but anyways, thank you.)</sup

          <h2 id="key-concepts" class="subtitle">
            a tool to a medium, a medium to a tool.
          </h2>
          <p class="body">
            Van de Seyp briefly mentioned something along the lines of how
            coding as a medium can achieve subtlety not achievable with other
            more traditional mediums. Which really gives rise to a thought that
            I have, do commonly used mediums change overtime with cultural and
            technological shifts? <br /><br />

            One example I had was taking a look at paper as a medium.
            Like imagine a printed poster on a letter sized draft bond. Why is it
            so popular? Is it because the medium itself is
            <span style="color: var(--green)">extremely accessible</span>, cheap
            to buy, and commonly found? Is it because the medium itself is
            <span style="color: var(--green)">versatile</span> to accommodate
            print, digital work, folding, as well as different material
            performance in paper types and feels?
            <br /><br />

            I wonder if coding, or the web-based work will ever develop into the
            same sort of versatility and stand on a similar pedestal as paper
            does today. In order for this to happen though, we're going to have
            to have:
            <br /><br />

            <ol>
              <li>
                Even more versatility, could be in the form of AR, or
                incorporating more physical interfacing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ease of access, tools could be developed in the future to make
                coding a lot more accessible for people, and advancements are
                already visible today.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dunno, just a thought on the potential progress of mediums from
                today.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br /><br />
          </p>

          <h2 id="practical-applications" class="subtitle">ways of thinking</h2>
          <p class="body">
            Another thing Van de Seyp mentioned during the lecture was her ways
            of thinking. She mentioned that she often starts more from
            curiosity, and embraces more unconventional ways of thinking. An
            example she gave was that she looked into how light refracted from a
            window, then built off of that unconventional concept. I gotta start
            incorporating this sort of exploration into my design process as
            well, as right now I think I find myself drifting towards more
            conventional design thinking, adhering to design paradigms, and
            mostly drawing inspiration from <span style="color: var(--green)">visual reference</span> 
            than <span style="color: var(--red)">abstract concepts</span>. <br /><br />

            I believe that taking a page out of her playbook and by drawing
            connotative inspiration from concepts, rather than the emulation of
            visual reference, we can probably create more “original” work. Not
            that I argue that any work is truly “original” nowadays, everyone
            has visual influences from works they digest, and nothing today is
            <span style="color: var(--green)">100% original</span> in the sense
            that it was not birthed from influence of another work. Which isn't a
            bad thing, it's amazing how the design and art space nurtures this
            method of thinking, and as a result I do not fret at the fact that
            none of my work is truly birthed from nothingness,
            <span style="color: var(--red)">created ex nihilo</span>, but instead
            take pride knowing it is a cumulation of my experience and the works
            of others.
          </p>

          <h2 id="critical-analysis" class="subtitle">automation</h2>
          <p class="body">
            Alas, we're back on <span style="color: var(--blue)">AI</span> again. It doesn't seem like we can escape the
            discourse around artificial intelligence today, especially given its
            exponential growth, and I guess we just gotta start integrating it
            into more discussions, and work today actually. <br /><br />

            Van de Seyp showcased a pretty amazing <span style="color: var(--blue)">automation tool</span> for type
            design. I believe it will automatically generate glyphs given a
            small sample size of glyphs you make in order to get a rough feel
            for the aesthetic and theme of the typeface. Although not fully
            polished and incredibly groundbreaking it is still a pretty amazing
            tool, and it really got me thinking about a general theme that AI is
            taking design. <br /><br />

            <sup style="color: var(--red)">
              “AI should do my dishes so I can focus on actually creating
              creative work, not the other way around.” (believe this quote was
              taken from a conference Yigit attended, I saw in his instagram
              sometime ago)</sup
            >
            <br /><br />

            I completely agree with this statement, and it got me thinking about
            to what extent, or rather, what can we consider as <span style="color: var(--green)"></span>“mundane” work</span>
            that should be automated? I think this is an incredibly nuanced area
            of discourse, especially considering the definition of mundane will
            drastically differ from person to person. I find typesetting to be
            <span style="color: var(--green)">ok,</span> it's not too bad but if there existed a plugin that would be
            able to automatically typeset my documents and layouts, I would jump
            at that opportunity. Personally, I find the most enjoyment in
            <span style="color: var(--red)">creating layouts, compositions, and thinking more so about the big
            picture</span> rather than getting granular with more technical details.
            Josh is different, that dude <span style="color: var(--blue)"></span>likes typesetting</span>, but hey to each and
            their own, but that's what I'm saying, everyone has differentiating
            values regarding what they regard as mundane, so ultimately what is
            gonna get automated first if there is no general consensus on what
            is mundane labor? <br /><br />
            
            With how tech is trending today, I think the focus
            on automation will literally just be whatever seems to be easier to
            achieve in the near future given the technological progress of
            today. Like if big tech thinks that automating typesetting will be
            achievable, and especially, economically viable and beneficial, they
            will focus on that.
